          <h2 style="color: #00008b"><i>Overview</i></h2>

          <p>
            Linear Smith Machines are the ultimate in weight machines and the
            LSM400 leads the field. Designed for both serious fitness users and
            beginners, the LSM400's vertical design provides all of the safety
            and control associated with Smith Machines, while still allowing for
            the effective use of gravity for effective resistance. You don't
            even need a workout partner. Lock points can be set to prevent the
            bar from movement outside of your body's natural range of motion.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can tailor the LSM400 to meet your specific workout needs. Start
            with the basic package of the Smith Machine rack and, as your needs
            grow, add a lat/row, pec dec, plate tree, dip, and accessory
            organizer. Accessories are easy to insert and remove, allowing you
            to continue your workout without delay. The LSM400 works with all
            standard Olympic weight plates.
          </p>

          <p>
            The LSM400 is compact with all components placed on one side of the
            unit for easy access. This makes the LSM400 perfect for people who
            want a quality home gym, but do not have a lot of space. Place the
            LSM400 against a wall and <i>you're ready to go</i>!
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Smooth Smith Action</b>: The bar (rated at 800 lb. capacity)
              slides on Teflon bushings alongside solid steel guide rods. Smooth
              motion is key to successful workouts, as the target muscles are
              utilized to their full potential with each repetition.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Proper Angle</b>: The bar travels along a 7 degree path from
              vertical. Studies have shown that this is the proper lifting angle
              to increase your comfort and prevent injury.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Safety</b>: The LSM400 has 20 lock-out points for a safe, solid
              stop at any point in your workout routine.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Rugged</b>: Constructed with heavy 12 gauge steel and 7 gauge
              reinforcing plate. This is a unit built to last.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Warranty</b>: Every part of the LSM400 has a lifetime
              guarantee. We will replace or repair anything that goes wrong.
            </li>

            <li><b>Dimensions</b>: Width: 85" Height: 82" Depth: 72"</li>
