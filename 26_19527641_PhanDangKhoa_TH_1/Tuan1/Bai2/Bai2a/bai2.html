    <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>
    <p>
      The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century,
      <b>Leonhard Euler</b> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied
      under another giant of mathematics, <b>Jean Bernoulli</b>. In 1731 Euler
      became a professor of physics and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of
      Sciences. Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time,
      publishing over 800 different books and papers. His influence was felt in
      physics and astronomy as well. Euler's work on mathematical analysis,
      <cite>Introductio in analysin infinitorum</cite> (1748) remained a
      standard textbook for well over a century. For the princess of
      Anhalt-Dessau he wrote
      <cite>Lettres a une princesse d'Allemagne</cite> (1768-1772), giving a
      clear non-technical outline of the main physical theories of the time.

      One can hardly do math without copying Euler. Notations still in use
      today, such as <i>e</i> and Ï€, were introduced in Euler's writings. He is
      perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's
      formula
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      cos(<i>x</i>) + isin(<i>x</i>) = <i>e</i> <sup>(<i>ix</i>)</sup>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, and
      trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive the equation
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>e</i><sup><i>(</i>&Pi;<i>i)</i></sup> + 1 = 0
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, &Pi;, <i>e</i>, and
      <i>i</i> in a single beautiful and elegant statement.
    </p>

      Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched,
      and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.
