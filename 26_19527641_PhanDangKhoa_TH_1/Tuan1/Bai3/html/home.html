        After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion,
        it really paid off. I have gotten so many enthusiastic comments about
        the wonderful performances that I've started putting up a
        <a href="../html/slide1.html" title="Go to the slide show"
          >slide show</a
        >
        of the production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web
        site. If you want high resolution photo files, please
